"
,"         As they fight , the panels light up in succession, and we see
"
,"         a silent , Maglev train hurdling right at them .

"

"

"

"

"
,"         picks up the knife that fell into the mines along with

"

"

"

"

"

"

"

"

"

"

"

"
,"          world. Wakanda will no longer watch
"
,"          from the shadows . We cannot , we
"
,"          must not. We will work to be an
"
,"          example of how we as brothers and
"
,"          sisters on this Earth should treat
"
,"          each other . Now more than ever ,
"
,"          illusions of division threaten our
"
,"          very e x istence. We all know the
"
,"          truth : more connects us than
"
,"          separates us . In times of crisis ,
"
,"          the wise build bridges , while the
"
,"          foolish build barriers . We must
"

"

"

"

"
,"         A meteorite drifts into frame , heading towards tiny Earth off
"
,"         in the distance.
"
,"          Millions of years ago , a meteorite
"
,"          made of vibranium, the strongest
"
,"          substance in the universe struck
"
,"          the continent of Africa affecting
"
,"          the plant life around it.
"
,"         The meteorite hits Africa and we see plant life and animals
"
,"         affected by vibranium.
"
,"          And when the time of man came , five
"
,"          tribes settled on it and called it
"
,"          Wakanda. The tribes lived in
"
,"          constant war with each other until
"
,"          a warrior shaman received a vision
"
,"          from the Panther goddess Bast who
"
,"          led him to the Heart Shaped Herb, a
"
,"          plant that granted him super human
"
,"          strength , speed, and instincts.
"
,"
"
,"         A visual representation of the five tribes emerges as hands
"
,"         from the sand animation, and we see them unite , and then
"
,"         break apart as conflict arises . Bashenga rises above the
"
,"         conflict and eats the Heart Shaped Herb, proceeding to unite
"
,"         the tribes .
"
,"          The warrior became King and the
"
,"          first Black Panther , the protector
"
,"          of Wakanda .
"
,"          2.
"
,"          Four tribes agreed to live under
"
,"          the King's rule , but the Jabari
"
,"          tribe isolated themselves in the
"
,"          mountains.
"
,"         We see the Jabari striding off towards the isolated mountain
"
,"         region.
"
,"          The Wakandans used vibranium to
"
,"          develop technology more advanced
"
,"          than any other nation , but as
"
,"          Wakanda thrived the world around it
"
,"          descended further into chaos.
"
,"         We see images of war and slavery just outside Wakanda ' s
"
,"         secretive border .
"
,"          To keep vibranium safe , the
"
,"          Wakandans vowed to hide in plain
"
,"          sight, keeping the truth of their
"
,"          power from the outside world.
"
,"         We see the protective barrier rise around the Wakandan city ,
"
,"         as we pull back on the Earth as it spins, now zooming in on

"

"

"
,"         The militants nod and the militant leader covers them while
"

"
,"         The militants move slowly following every sound . They point
"
,"         their guns at the base of a TREE, but it ' s just a stray DOG.
"
,"         The gunmen approach the tree, eyeing around , then look up to
"

"
,"         The . SO CAL GUNNERand all of the other men in the convoy

"

"

"

"
,"         and using the BARRELlike a combat stick, puts him on his
"
,"         back , out cold.
"
,"         She leaps onto a second militant, easily taking him down and
"
,"         striking him in the throat.
"

"
,"         The four men don't see Panther coming and executing a BARRAGE
"
,"         OF PUNCHESAND KICKS, Panther viciously dispatches them. He
"
,"         spots the Young Militant firing at him then SLASHES through a
"
,"         car door, and THROWS THE DOORat a Militant behind him-
"
,"         taking him out.
"
,"         In a moment of desperation , the Young Militant rushes out ,
"
,"         firing at Panther to no effect. Then , as Panther walks
"
,"         towards him, Nakia dives out , kicking the young militant's
"
,"         gun from his hand and grabs him in a neck-lock.
"
,"         Swinging around , Nakia kicks Panther in the chest, stopping
"
,"         his momentum. Caught off guard, Panther freezes .
"
,"          This one is just a boy . .. he got
"
,"          kidnapped as well.
"
,"         Nakia pulls the wrap from the young militant's face , exposing
"
,"         his pre-teen expression. She removes her own hijab as well.
"
,"         Panther stares at her- for a beat too long ...
"
,"          Nakia . . . I . . . I wanted to ...
"
,"          Hey! 1 !
"

"

"

"

"

"

"

"
,"         form a semicircle behind him , pointing their spears at his
"
,"         back.
"
,"         T'Challa lifts his hand and calls out for the Dora, who fall
"
,"         into place behind him, making a perfect CIRCLE OF SPEARS
"
,"         surrounding the fighters.
"
,"         Zuri raises his hand, ill-at-ease .
"

"

"
,"         counter with TWOFIERCE KICKS.

"
,"         M'Baku charges at T'Challa , knuckle-walking , and slipping his
"

"
,"         his strength trying to impale T'Challa on the TIPS.
"

"
,"         We see YOUNGT'CHALLA and YOUNGT'CHAKA smiling at each
"

"
,"
"
,"         We see images of T'Challa and T'Chaka from CA: CW. Father puts
"

"
,"         T'Challa, eyes closed, struggles with the memories as he

"
,"         The children begin burying T'Challa in the red sand .

,"
"
,"         The explosion from CA: CW kills T'Chaka , and we see T'Challa
"

"
,"
"
,"         T'Challa puts on his father's ring.
"
,"
"
,"         zuri is the last thing T'Challa sees as his face is buried.
"
,"
"
,"         T'Challa comes out of the dirt . There are stars above . He's
"
,"         in a VAST GRASSLAND somewhere in Wakanda with wondrous acacia
"
,"         trees . It's surreal and beautiful.
"
,"          28 .
"
,"
"
,"         A massive ACACIA TREE stands in front of him . T'Challa sees
"
,"         several YELLOW EYES looking at him and realizes PANTHERSare
"
,"         resting on the branches of the tree . T'Challa approaches. A
"
,"         large panther jumps down , then stands on two feet to reveal
"
,"         it's T'CHAKA .
"
,"         T'Challa lo oks at his father and immediately pulls him into a
"
,"         hug.
"
,"          Baba!
"
,"          My son.
"
,"         T'Challa kneels down before his father , overcome with grief.
"
,"          I am sorry .
"
,"          Stand up! You are a King.
"
,"         T'Challa rises, and they begin to walk.
"
,"          What is wrong my son?
"
,"          I am not ready, Baba.
"
,"          Have you not prepared to be King
"
,"          your whole life? Have you not
"
,"          trained and studied, been by my
"
,"          side?
"
,"          That is not what I am talking
"
,"          about . I am not ready to be without
"
,"          you.
"
,"          A man who has not prepared his
"
,"          children for his own death has
"
,"          failed as a father.
"
,"          Have I ever failed you?
"
,"          29 .
"
,"
"
,"
"
,"          Never .
"

"
,"          King, Baba . Just like you .
"
,"          You're going to struggle. So you
"
,"          need to surround yourself with
"
,"          people you trust . You're a good man
"
,"          with a good heart . And it's hard
"
,"          for a good man to be King .
"
,"
"
,"         T'Challa is aggressively pulled from the dirt by Zuri.
"
,"          Breathe , T'Challa. Breathe !
"
,"         T'Challa breathes in deeply , coughing up dirt . His battle
"
,"         wounds have healed.
"
,"          He was there ! He was there . My
"
,"          father.
"

"

"
,"          Corne home , Nakia .
"
,"          I'm right here .
"
,"          Stay.
"
,"          I came to support you , and to honor
"
,"          your father. But I can't stay. It's
"
,"          just ... ! found my calling out
"
,"          there . I've seen too many in need
"
,"          just to turn a blind eye . I can't
"
,"          be happy here knowing that there's
"
,"          people out there who have nothing .
"
,"         T'Challa thinks on this .
"
,"          30 .
"
,"
"
,"
"
,"          What would you have Wakanda do
"
,"          about it?
"
,"         Nakia thinks for a bit .
"
,"          Share what we have. We could
"
,"          provide aid and access to
"
,"          technology and refuge to those who
"
,"          need it ... other countries do it,
"
,"          we do it better.
"
,"          We are not like these other
"
,"          countries, Nakia. If the world
"
,"          found out what we truly are, and
"
,"          what we possess -- we could lose
"
,"          our way of life.
"
,"          Wakanda is strong enough to help
"
,"          others and protect ourselves at the
"
,"          same time .
"
,"         Nakia gives T'Challa a look .
"
,"          If you were not so stubborn you
"
,"          would make such a great queen.
"
,"          I would make a great queen because
"
,"          I am so stubborn .
"
,"          Ah! So you admit it !
"
,"          . .· if that's what I wanted !
"
,"
"
,"
"
,"         We TRACKPAST several Border Tribesmen in a field, feeding
"
,"         and watering their pet HORSES and GOATS.
"
,"         Finally we come upon . . . W'Kabi feeding M20, his MASSIVE PET
"
,"         RHINO by hand . T'Challa stands beside him .
"
,"          Is that him? Glory to Bast, man, is
"
,"          he still growing?
"
,"          31.
"
,"
"
,"
"
,"         W'Kabi laughs .
"
,"          Of course.
"
,"          I see Nakia is back ... you guys
"
,"          going to work it out?
"
,"         T'Challa shakes his head and crosses in front of W'Kabi .
"
,"          T'Challa, what's wrong?
"
,"          Nakia thinks we should be doing
"
,"          more .
"
,"          More like what?
"
,"          Foreign aid ... refugee programs.
"
,"         W'Kabi shakes his head.
"
,"          You let refugees in , they bring
"
,"          their problems with them. And then
"
,"          Wakanda is like everywhere else.
"
,"         T'Challa thinks on this.
"
,"          Now, if you said you wanted me and
"
,"          my men to go out there and clean up
"
,"          the world , then I'd be all for it.
"
,"          But waging war on other countries
"
,"          has never been our way .
"
,"         Then , both of their Kimoyo beads buzz.
"
,"          You too, huh?
"
,"          Bast, are we in trouble?
"
,"         Their beads combine to project a display of Okoye .
"
,"          32 .
"

"
,"
"
,"          My King . My love. You will never

"
,"          ornate chamber overlooking the Golden City . At the top of
"
,"         a golden pyramid, T' Challa , W'Kabi, Ramonda and ELDERS from
"
,"         each tribe except the Jabari sit in a circle as Okoye briefs
"
,"         them . W'Kabi and Ramonda flank T'Challa's throne .
"
,"          A misidentified Wakandan artifact
"
,"          was stolen yesterday from a British
"
,"          museum . We have learned Ulysses
"
,"          Klaue plans to sell the vibraniurn
"
,"          to an American buyer in South Korea
"
,"          tomorrow night .
"
,"         There are audible murmurs at the name of Ulysses Klaue .
"
,"          Klaue has escaped our pursuits for
"
,"          almost 30 years. Not capturing him
"
,"          was perhaps my father's greatest
"
,"          regret . I wish to bring Klaue back
"
,"          here to stand trial .
"
,"          Wakanda does not need a warrior
"
,"          right now . We need a King .
"
,"          My parents were killed when he
"
,"          attacked . Not a day goes by when I
"
,"          do not think about what Klaue took
"
,"          from us, from me.
"
,"          It's too great an opportunity to
"
,"          pass.
"

"
,"          Do you like that one?
"
,"          Tempting . But the idea is to not be
"

"
,"         Shuri uses her Kimoyo beads to sync the suit to T'Challa.
"
,"          (pointing at the necklace)
"
,"          Now tell it to go on.
"
,"         T'Challa does, and without warning, MILLIONS of vibranium
"

"

"
,"          Oooh! ! The entire suit sits within

"
,"          Not that hard, genius!
"

"

"

"

"
,"         Okoye turns to T'Challa .
"
,"          We can't let him talk to Klaue
"

"
,"          Better to let him talk to Klaue
"
,"          alone for 5 minutes than to make a
"

"
,"          What? No. Look I like you, a lot.
"
,"          But he's in my custody now. He's

"
,"          If he touches you again, I am going
"
,"          to impale him to this desk.
"
,"         Ross looks at Okoye, sensing the thinly veiled threat. He
"
,"         looks to T'Challa .
"
,"          Does she speak English?
"
,"          When she wants to.
"
,"         Ross and Okoye eye each other for a long beat.
"

"

"
,"          You know, you really shouldn ' t
"
,"          trust the Wakandans. I'm much more
"
,"          your speed.
"
,"          I don't trust anybody, not in this
"
,"          job . But what I am interested in is
"
,"          that arm cannon out there. Where'd
"
,"          you get that?
"
,"          It's an old mining tool that I made
"
,"          some adjustments to. But I can get
"
,"          you one if you'd like .
"
,"          Why don't you give me the name of
"
,"          your supplier and I'll ask them.
"
,"          He's right outside , why don't you
"
,"          ask him yourself?
"
,"          T' Challa? You're telling me that
"
,"          weapon on your arm is from Wakanda?
"
,"         Klaue nods.
"
,"          Bingo .
"
,"          What do you actually know about
"
,"          Wakanda?
"
,"          Shepherds . Textiles . Cool outfits.
"
,"         Ross stops as we notice a MICRO AUDIO BUG on his shoulder
"

"

"

"
,"          Dorado : The Golden City . They
"
,"          thought they could find it in South
"
,"          America, but it was in Africa the
"
,"          whole time . A technological marvel.
"
,"          All because it was built on a mound
"
,"          of the most valuable metal known to
"
,"          man- Isipho- they call it . The
"
,"          gift . Vibranium ...
"
,"          Vibranium yea . Strongest metal on
"
,"          Earth.
"
,"          It's not just a metal ... They sew
"
,"          it into their clothes , it powers
"
,"          their city, their tech, their
"
,"          weapons ...
"
,"          Weapons?
"
,"          Oh yes . Makes my arm cannon look
"
,"          like a leaf blower .
"
,"          That's a nice fairy tale but
"
,"          Wakanda is a third world country
"
,"          and you stole all their vibranium .
"
,"          I stole all of it?
"
,"         Klaue can barely contain himself.
"
,"          All of it? I took a tiny piece of
"
,"          it . They have a mountain full of
"
,"          it. They've been mining it for
"
,"          thousands of years and still
"
,"          haven't scratched the surface .
"

"

"

"

"

"

"
,"          I don't care that you brought

"

"

"
,"          that looks like us but their lives
"
,"          are a lot harder , Wakanda has the
"
,"          tools to liberate them all .
"
,"          And what tools are those?
"
,"          Vibranium . Your weapons.
"
,"          Our our weapons will not be used to
"

"
,"          executioner for people who are not
"

"

"
,"          here , on this continent? So ain ' t
"

"

"

"

"

"

"

"
,"          He has no rights here.
"
,"          The challenge would take weeks to
"

"

"

"

,"          Overthrow? ! Nakia , I am not a spy
"

"

"

"
,"          It's beautiful .
"
,"         T'Challa thinks for a long beat.
"
,"          Maybe we can still heal you .
"
,"         Killmonger thinks on this .
"
,"          Why? So you can just lock me up?
"
,"          Nah . Just bury me in the ocean,
"
,"          with my ancestors that jumped from
"

"
,"          was better than bondage.
"
,"         Killmonger pulls the knife out of his chest, killing himself
"
,"         instantly. T'Challa looks down at his cousin's now lifeless
"
,"         body and becomes emotional.

"

"
,"          Stay . I think I know a way you can
"

"

"
,"         now abandoned apartment building . In the distance a group of
"
,"         SIX KIDS (mostly Black, some Latino), play three on a rugged
"
,"         basketball hoop .
"
,"          When you said you would take me to
"

"

"
,"          Disneyland . Why here?
"
,"          This is where our father killed our
"
,"          uncle.
"
,"         Shuri looks at T'Challa, shocked by his bluntness. She turns
"
,"         and stares closely at the building. We see her POV of large
"
,"         SIGNAGE that hints that the building is soon to be
"

"
,"          They're not tearing it down . . . I
"
,"          bought this building.
"
,"         Shuri turns to him confused .
"
,"          And that building , and that one
"
,"          over there ... This will be the
"

"

"

"
,"          You're kidding !
"
,"         T'Challa hits a button on his Kimoyo bead , and the RTF comes
"

"

"
,"         A YOUNG BLACKKID turns back to see the ship as the other
"

"
,"          What? ! Man what the hell is that?
"
,"          That's like a Buggati space ship !
"

"

"

"
,"
"
,"         They start to run up to the ship and touch it . Unsure at
"

"
,"          We can take this back to the house
"
,"          y'all. ..

"

"

"

"
,"         She starts off towards the kids, walking past the Young Black
"
,"         Kid.
"
,"          Uhhh I wouldn't do that if I were
"
,"          you guys ...
"
,"          Where you come from?
"
,"          From Wakanda .
"

"
,"         The Young Black Kid approaches T'Challa .
"
,"          Hey yo ! Is this yours?
"
,"          Who... who are you?
"

"
,"         Several assembly members move around the room preparing for a
"
,"         meeting . Suddenly a hush falls over the hall as the Wakandans
"
,"         enter and walk up to the center pit.
"
,"          My name is King T'Challa , son of
"
,"          King T'Chaka . I am the sovereign
"
,"          ruler of the Nation of Wakanda and
"
,"          for the first time in our history
"
,"          we will be sharing our knowledge
"
,"          and resources with the outside
"
,"          world. Wakanda will no longer watch
"
,"          from the shadows . We cannot , we
"
,"          must not. We will work to be an
"
,"          example of how we as brothers and
"
,"          sisters on this Earth should treat
"
,"          each other . Now more than ever ,
"
,"          illusions of division threaten our
"
,"          very e x istence. We all know the
"
,"          truth : more connects us than
"
,"          separates us . In times of crisis ,
"
,"          the wise build bridges , while the
"
,"          foolish build barriers . We must
"
,"          find a way to look after one
"
,"          another, as if we were one single
"
,"          tribe .
"
,"         The audience of WORLD LEADERS look around , bemused, wondering
"
,"         what Wakanda could possibly have to offer .
"
,"          can't help but lean into his microphone .
"
,"          With all due respect , King
"
,"          T'Challa , what can a nation of
"
,"          farmers offer to the rest of the
"
,"          world?
"
,"         There are a few chuckles from the gallery . Nakia , Okoye and
"
,"         Ayo share a look.
"
,"         T'Challa smiles .

"

"

"
,"         The kids race out of the hut and over to Shuri.
"
,"          Are you playing around with that
"

"
,"          No. Nol
"
,"          You're teasing him again?
"
,"         Bucky exits the hut to the sight of a beautiful Wakandan
"
,"         lakeside. He takes it all in with a deep breath . Outside the
"
,"         hut are WAKANDAN SHAMAN (Man and Woman) and SHURI, embracing
"

"

"

"

"
,"          Good morning , Sgt . Barnes .
"
,"          Bucky .
"
,"          How are you feeling?
"
,"          Good. Thank you.
"
,"         Shuri smiles.
"
,"          Come. Much more for you to learn.
"
,"
"
,         He follows Shuri towards the other huts.
